    <h2 class="ribbon">Hi, I'm Jesse :<span>}</span></h2>
    <p>I’m a product designer living in New York, NY. I am currently the Creative Director at DigitalOcean, leading the product design & brand design teams. While a happy, well-functioning team is mission critical, I spend most of my time thinking through design systems, designing interfaces, and coding deep into the night.</p>

    <h2 class="ribbon">Jesse is a user advocate</h2>
    <p>I am solutions-focused designer. While designing pretty interfaces is rewarding, designing systems under a series of constraints is my bread n' butter. I am extremely excited that we are seeing a global shift towards a more user-focused design appraoch - now design is critical to the success of a product.</p>

      <h2 class="ribbon">The things I love</h2>
      <p>Titles don't matter to me that much. Here are the things I like to do: Research, Whiteboard, Sketch, Prototype, Build. I love to prototype and build ideas. I love learning new technologies and putting them to use. I love to socialie my product work using as many diagrams as humanly possible. I love solving complex problems through think tanks and design studios. I love spending time with users, and humanizing the people we are designing for. I love spending time perfecting web animations until they feel organic. I love staying on the bleeding edge of Front End technology. I love giving back to our wonderful community. At the end of the day, <strong>I love building product</strong>.</p>
