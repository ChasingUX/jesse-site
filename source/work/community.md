##What is the community
There are over 1 billion websites on the internet, and far less System Administrators to configure servers for these sites that have complex and varying needs. The DigitalOcean community platform aims to make SysAdmins live's easier as they begin or continue their journey in learning system administration subjects.

When I started working on the Community, it already existed in a rudimentary state â€” a blog with hundreds of tutorials complimented by a fairly traditional forum. Due to quality, timliness, and technical accuracy of the tutorials, content was indexed extremely well by Google. For instance, if I were to search a very common beginner SysAdmin subject in google `set up password authentication apache`, a DigitalOcean tutorial would be in the top three results. This created a reliable influx of traffic to the tune of about 5 million unique visits per month, representing about 90% of all community traffic! The community was less of a destination, and more of a collection of amazing tutorials that google deemed a top resource.

The challenge became clear - we must continue writing quality content, and shift our product into a destination for developers to help and learn from one another. **We must build, a community.**

By leveraging the communities existing content and readership, we were able to create more than just a resource for SysAdmins, but a rich platform for them to learn and better themselves in their field.

#The New Community
Community 2.0 is a brand new app, rebuilt to meet our goals. The content is comprised of three main sections:

<ol>
  <li><strong>Tutorials</strong><br>1300+ tutorials written with love by DigitalOcean writers. </li>
  <li><strong>Q&A</strong><br>Community-generated questions and answers on SysAdmin subjects. </li>
  <li><strong>Projects</strong><br>Apps, Wrappers, and other integrations built on top of the DigitalOcean API. </li>  
</ol>

The app's IA is built around these three core buckets of content, as well as the user and tag objects.

##Browsing the plethora of content
Building towards the goal of a destination, the thousands of resources the community provides must be easily accessible. So when we have so much content, each covering vastly different subjects, what is the best way to locate this content? First, we must understand the user. The majority of users who arrive an the community already have a particular topic in mind. They aren't here to explore a wide array of subjects, but rather one particular area of focus. Based on this assumption, we wanted to build a powerful search that delivers instant and relevant results from the first keystroke.

<a class="enlarge border" href="/assets/images/projects/community/search_closeup.gif">
  <img src="/assets/images/blank.jpg" data-src="/assets/images/projects/community/search_closeup.gif">
</a>

Using [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), we built a super powerful search tool, and tested a few different combinations of filtering options, algorithm changes, and metadata integrations. There were some interesting learnings, particulary around tags.

As tags play a vital role in classifying resources, we tested their usefulness as a part of the search UI. We found that users were not using tags as a search tool and prefered to search using free-form writing based on their needs. While tags are still a very important part of the search algorithm and tutorial metadata, users prefer to surface content via search bar versus traversing a heierchy tree of many tags. If a user searchers `nginx` on `centos 7`, it immediately returns the exact content they need. If a user is looking for the newest or trending content, filtering options are available.

##Consuming Tutorial Content
The core of the DigitalOcean community lies with the tutorial content and the reading experience. As the majority of content-consumers come from Google search results, the reading experience must be optimized for quick and easy consumption of content. Users are presented with a distraction free, easy to follow tutorial with tools such as tables of contents, and multi-lingual translations.

<a class="enlarge border" href="/assets/images/projects/community/tutorial-single.jpg">
  <img src="/assets/images/blank.jpg" data-src="/assets/images/projects/community/tutorial-single.jpg">
</a>

The tutorial UI is optimized for reading and building. Because the nature of the content is so technical, common behavior is for readers to toggle back and forth between the tutorial and a programming environment, so much focus needed to be placed on the display of code. Code examples need to be informative in how they are displayed, therefore editorial control must be extremely flexible (more on that later).

## Show some love - the 'Heart'
Throughout the community lives a very special icon - the heart. The heart action is used to show appreciation to other community users for their contributions. While hearts do not have a 1:1 correlation with popularity or caliber, they are a fairly accurate indicator of quality content.

##Commenting
Unlike the DigitalOcean blog, which uses the Disqus commenting platform, we wanted to roll out our own commenting system that provided a much richer suite of functionality. As commenting is the core form of user interaction within the community, we wanted to adopt UX patterns that were fairly known as a foundation, and extend it with useful features for the technical publisher.

We required unlimited threading for conversations at any thread depth, the presence of social profiles accessible through user avatars, very concise actions (heart, reply, report), and a clear design, with enough whitespace to meet the DO aesthetic, but not enough that renders a 100+ comment thread unreadable. Comments also needed to be optimized for code display, so rich wysiwyg editorial control was essential.

  <img src="/assets/images/blank.jpg" data-src="/assets/images/projects/community/commentsA.jpg">

</a>

The real magic lies in the wysiwyg. A well-made rich text editor (also known as wysiwyg) is absolutely critical in effective content publishing. After reviewing all of the open source tools out there, we decided to roll out our own, in what I condiser to be the single most useful component in the app.

</a>

We are not creating a tool for publishers, rather developers. It needs to display code just as well as it does long-form content, and must meet the following requirements:

   - Fully supports markdown as well as custom markdown commands
   - Offers rich fomatting for non-code content
   - Features syntax highlighting, with custom language support
   - Offers instant previewing on the client side

##Q&A Platform
As a front-end dev and designer, I am often developing my own work. When I am stuck on say a JavaScript problem, I might use Stack Overflow in hopes that more knowledgable devs can assist â€” it is an invaluable Q&A app because of it's engaged community of developers. 

While the DigitalOcean community offers curated tutorial content, we wanted to build a feature that allows users to ask free-form questions to the rest of the community, similar to that of Stack Overflow (or specifically, ServerVault). Since the release of this feature, over 12,000 questions have been asked, of which the vast majority have answers.

###Ask a question
As a user, you may have read a tutorial and are left with certain questions, or have a question related to system administration. The ask a question flow is extremely simple - a user types in their question using the same wsiwig that powers comments, with more advanced controls like h1-h3 headers. After submission it is run through our spam filter to protect against bots. If it passes, it publishes immediately for the rest of the community to engage with.

{image of ask question page with content filled out}

###The Question
Questions are formatted with the question on top and a series of answers below. There are three objects that form a Q&A discussion - the question, the answer(s), and comment(s). A user can comment on a question or an answer, or they can simply provide a direct answer to the question. This is similar to that of Stack Overflow, but unlike Stack Overflow, the asker of the question is not able to mark a single answer as 'correct'.  

Our belief is simple: There are often multiple correct answers, each with vastly different solutions. Instead of allowing only one 'correct' answer, we want to allow the entire community to 'heart' answers to form a appreciation-based ordering of quality answers.

##Projects
Tutorials, questions and answers all provide knowledge and inspiration to build. The projects section showcases tools that users have built on top of the DigitalOcean API. Split between services, API wrappers, apps, and other integrations, all of the projects reflect the strength of the community in that our users are learning from the informative content and building rich integrations.

On the projects page, users can interact with one another using comments, similar to a github project page.

## User Management
So what does it mean to be a registered user of the community? Being a registered user not only allows you to interact with and create content, but also allows you to manage your content, profile, and preferences, subscribe to topics of interest, and control your flow of notifications.

###Profile
A user's profile houses information and content relating to the user. Profiles are open and public, and serve as a user's social identity within the community. If I were to visit a user's profile, I could learn about their interests, view external social accounts or projects, and see their contributions to the DigitalOcean Community. As the owner of a profile, I can use it to manage my questions, answers, comments, projects, etc.

### Notifications & Subscriptions
As a user, if I were to comment, I want to be notified if anyone replies. This is how most commenting platforms function, but our perspective is slightly different. We send notifications to a user if they are 'subscribed' to particular form of content. There are two ways a user can be 'subscribed' to an entity: 

1. If a user creates content (comment, question, answer, project) they are automatically subscribed to all replies (be it a answer or comment).
2. A user manually subscribes to content by clicking the subscribe button.

{image of subscribe box checked on a tutorial or question}

As a very active user, recieving notifications on subscribed content can sometimes be a nuisance. Users need utlimate control over their flow of notifications or they will leave in an overwelmed and helpless state. The Community offers a fairly robust set of controls to change the frequency and type of notifications.

{gif of notifications settings screen, changing frequency}

Outside of notification settings, users can manage all of the content they are subscribed to in one easy place for quick changes to subscriptions. 

{image of subscriptions screen}

After settings ans subscriptions are set, a user manages the notifications through the alerts dropdown. Notifications are considered â€˜acknowledgedâ€™ if they are viewed by the user. If a user has many notifications in the dropdown, they are â€˜acknowledgedâ€™ as soon as they are visible in the dropdown viewport. The background color fades from blue to white, affording the acknowledgement.

##Moving Forward
While the above features serve as a fantastid foundation for future development, we have aready seen major increases in traffic, signups, engagement, conversion to cloud, and most importantly, love from the community:
