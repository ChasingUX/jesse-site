##Prologue
The DigitalOcean cloud is a highly complex product, which warrants a series of case studies with singular focus. In the coming months, I will be releasing detailed case studies covering the following aspects of cloud: user onboarding, team accounts, abuse flow, objects and networks, rails to ember conversion, DNS, floating IPs, and the Droplet experience.

Below is a deliberate oversimplification of the product by highlighting the information architecture on a per-page basis. Research, prototyping, flow work, and learnings will be released in future cloud case studies, as outlined above. 

##The early days
When I started working at DigitalOcean in September of 2013, our cloud had a reputation for being an extremely simple hosting platform. It was known for it's ease-of-use, SSD drives, and quick spin-up time. Our competition was comprised of major tech jaugernauts â€“ Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Rackspace. 

These companies provided a far more robust feature set, which was believed to be neccesary to compete in this space. But the competition did not place much of a focus on the user experience and design of the interface. As these products became more and more complex, so did their experiences. Perhaps there <em>is</em> room in this space for a simple, user-first approach to hosting!

##The power of simplicity
DigitalOcean had <em>and still has</em> a pretty outragious opportunity. We can disrupt this space by providing an extremely simple and straightforward experience designed to make developers lives easier. While we were already revered for our simple approach, there was and <em>still is</em> much room for streamlining the overall experience and making infrastucture management a much easier pill to swallow. Now, we have climbed the ranks to the second largest hosting company in the world, based on NetCraft's data. Simplicity can go a long way.

<div class="Note">
  <h4>Cloud Hosting 101</h4>
  <p>Without going into the highly technical details of cloud hosting, we can think of a cloud as a combination of compute, networking, and storage resources created on virtualized servers. Servers are provisioned for heavy computation, communication, and storage of assets and databases.</p>

  <p>While DigitalOcean is diligently working to build out storage and networking features today, our current product offering is based on the Droplet - a compute instance. This case study will focus primarily on the Droplet (compute) with little focus on networking and storage.</p>

##Cloud Information Architecture
We will only focus on a few of these areas, most notably, droplet, images, and networking.
